# Words of Discouragement

Words of Discouragement is a Roblox Studio plugin based on pa00's "Words of Encouragement".  
Instead of displaying motivational quotes, like pa00's plugin, this one discourages you.  

# Installation

There are many ways to install WoD. You can either install it from the Roblox library marketplace, download the rbxmx release or editing and exporting it as a local Roblox Plugin.  
This project is still under development, so the only way to download the plugin would be to export it as a plugin manually.  
Don't expect it to work out of the box yet, since it is still a work in progress and is subject to major changes.

# Usage

WoD has a UI interface for you to visualize your friends with the quotes and also a settings menu where you can configure how WoD should be working.
